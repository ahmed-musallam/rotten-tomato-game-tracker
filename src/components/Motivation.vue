      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <p>I recentely started learning <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> and I fell in love with it! And I was looking for a simple starter app I can build to demo what I have learned so far.</p>
      <p>At my company, we have a call every friday and sometimes we play this game called 'rotten tomato'. The Idea is that the CEO would pick a few movies and a few members of the team to participate. The players job is to give an estimate of the rotten tomato score for each movie. In the end, the player with the closest overal estimate to all the movies wins and recieves a prize!</p>
      <p>Usually, one specific member of the team is tasked with keeping track of all the scores, and thats why I built this, but primarely for fun :)</p>
